yooo it is us team hell_os here to give FEEDBACK and all that GOOD STUFF

Comments:
- The descriptions are great! Detailed and epic.
- The component map needs simplification
- It's confusing having FlaskApp multiple times
- You're also mixing it up with the sitemap a bit, we think.
- Arrows other than that one arrow needs description.
- Consider an additional name field that isn't the username
- Several members commented on their distaste for the blocky arrows.
- Please these arrows are pain. Especially the three going from review creation to home page.
- Overall sitemap organization would be nice.
- Tasks probably should be assigned to people
